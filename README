Quick guide on usage:

* Compile PropEr (run 'make', or 'make all' if you also want to build the
  documentation)
* Add PropEr's base directory to your ERL_LIBS environment variable - I do this
  by adding the following line to my ~/.bashrc file:
  'export ERL_LIBS=~/path/to/proper'
* Add the following include line to all source files containing properties you
  wish to test:
  '-include_lib("proper/include/proper.hrl").'
* Compile your source files.
* For each property, run:
  'proper:check(your_module:some_property()).'
